This repository proposes code for analysis of quantitative finance situations.

The models implemented are based on personal research and academic literature as described in each analysis.

Comments and suggestions for improvements are welcomed.

## Model behaviour with actual data
* FRA convexity adjustment in the rational multi-curve two-factor model.
* Cap/floor implied volatility in the rational multi-curve two-factor model.
* SONIA futures convexity adjustment. Used in working paper Marc Henrard, Overnight Futures: Convexity Adjustment. February 2018. Available at (https://ssrn.com/abstract=3134346)
* IBOR fallback: convexity adjustment for spot rate approach.
* Calibration of curves with overnight/overnight basis swaps. Impact on delta risk.
* LIBOR fallback GBP-USD: historical time series analysis

## Regulations

* FRTB: Imaginary capital for some positions. The matrix used as
  (pseudo-)correlation is not positively defined.

# Professional services

The models proposed here are only a small part of the code we have developed or have access to for research and advisory services purposes. Don’t hesitate to contact us if you are interested by other models, require advisory services or are looking for a training around similar models.

## Trainings and workshops

We propose in-house training and workshops on subjects related to quantitative finance and risk management.

We offer extensive flexibility on the training organization.

A in-house tailor-made course with our experts presented to your full team often costs less than sending two people to a standard course organized by a large training firm.

*Agenda tailored to your needs. Detailed lecture notes.*
*Associated to open source code for practical implementation.*
*Training in English or in French*

Some of the popular courses are (course description and typical agendas available through the links):
* Multi-curve and collateral framework: foundations, evolution and implementation. <https://murisq.blogspot.com/p/training.html#multicurve>
* The future of LIBOR: Quantitative perspective on benchmarks, overnight, fallback and regulation. <https://murisq.blogspot.com/p/training.html#libor-future>
* Algorithmic Differentiation in Finance. <https://murisq.blogspot.com/p/training.html#ad>
* Central clearing and bilateral margin. <https://murisq.blogspot.com/p/training.html#margin>
