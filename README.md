* [muRisQ Advisory](http://murisq.com/)

This repository proposes code for analysis of quantitative finance situations.

The models implemented are based on personal research and academic literature as described in each analysis.

Comments and suggestions for improvements are welcomed.

## Model behaviour with actual data
* FRA convexity adjustment in the rational multi-curve two-factor model.
* Cap/floor implied volatility in the rational multi-curve two-factor model.
* SONIA futures convexity adjustment. Used in working paper Marc Henrard, Overnight Futures: Convexity Adjustment. February 2018. Available at (https://ssrn.com/abstract=3134346)

## Regulations

* FRTB: Imaginary capital for some positions. The matrix used as
  (pseudo-)correlation is not positively defined.



## Professional services

The model proposed here are only a small part of the code I developed or have access to for research and advisory services purposes. Donâ€™t hesitate to contact me if you are interested by other models, require advisory services or are looking for a training around similar model.

### Training
